# Project: Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition

This project is the second part of the *Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition* course.

Part of the code was given by our professor Diakoloukas Vasilis. 

It is implemented in Python and covers the fundamentals of the subject:

1. Perceptron Algorithm
2. Logistic Regression: Gradient
3. Parameters estimation: Maximum Likelihood
4. K-Means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models
5. Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition (Fashion-MNIST)
